# This post was archived from my original Jekyll-based site

Finally, a new website that isn't totally stolen from someone else. Though I am kind of cheating as I'm using Jekyll to make this. Anyways, let's talk about this 
here new website. As I've stated, I am using Jekyll to make this site so It's a bit easier on me. This website is going to be a general blogging/tutorial/whatever 
website for me to post about my projects and other things I do in my spare time. 

I am doing other things in my time currently (ex. spending time with the other humans), but I will be working on more projects sooner or later. I haven't
published a new YouTube video lately so I intend on doing some more of those eventually. I plan on learning some more programming languages over the summer period. I will be working on C and Swift in particualr, but I may change my mind. 

Some projects I've been working on lately are 
1. This website 
2. Learning Ansible
3. Working on my Docker skills
4. Learning the aforementioned launguages (C and Swift)

So you can expect more to come from me in relation to these things. I am attemping to whip up an Ansible playbook to install Docker on any computer so look forward to that. 

Anyways, I've got some more work to do here so I am going to end this blog post update thing here. See y'all later.
