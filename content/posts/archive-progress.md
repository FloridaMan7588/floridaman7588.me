# This post was archived from my original Jekyll-based site

Hey, long time no see, or write I guess. Well, I'm working on the website again. This is just a progress post, and as you can see a lot of progress has been made. I have started school so things may not be as frequent as I'd like them to be but it's really whatever. AFAIK, my schedule should allow for at least an hour of work each day, but that may be limited by other factors(eg. family whatevers or having a social life). I do have some other projects that I'm working on, so this website isn't the number 1 priority (btw you can check out those other projects [here](https://floridaman7588.me/projects)).
