# This post was archived from my original Jekyll-based site

Guess who's back, back again. Yeah it's been a while, I'm aware. Remember when I Tweeted saying I would upload a video in a week and then went radio silent for a few months, yeah me neither. I wonder if that's because it was nearly 7 months ago or if I just have a bad memory. Well yeah I know it's weird that I come back now but I have my reasons. For example, I've been in school the whole time, and though I'm not even in high school, I've still been extremely busy. Not only have I been in school, but I've had many different personal things going on, not allowing for much time to work on my projects. Now that it's summer time, I've got all the time that I need to work on my projects. 

As for those projects, I had decided, during the period of which I had no time, that I will scrap or at least Backburnerâ„¢ some projects, including my iOS related projects. These include that one Reddit bot I was going to make, my Cydia repository(s), and some other stuff. Now I will continue to work on this website of course, as well as my [waterfox-flatpak](https://github.com/floridaman7588/waterfox-flatpak) project, and potentially my ca-server or EasyCA project too. I will continue to be active over my summer break, or at least try to be, and I will continue to update some of my projects. 

I did make many changes and updates to this website as well, including fixing mobile support and removing some of those deprecated or archived projects from the navigation bar. You can still access the pages for those projects through the projects tab, but they are most likely unsupported by me. I also added official support for RSS and a proper sitemap file. As for the end user experience, I added pagination and some sharing options as supported by the Alembic Jekyll theme that I use to build this site. I also created a privacy policy, and credited the original author of the theme on the footer. Thats about it in terms of site upgrades, or at least uodates of things that you might notice.

I also intend on streaming quite a bit, and I spent like a day setting up my OBS so I plan not to let that go to waste. You should know where to find me by now, but if you don't, all my social links can be found at https://fm7588.me/links. I will be streaming on both YouTube and Twitch, and I will stream on multiple YouTube accounts for different reasons (My primary YouTube for code stuff, and my secondary for games). I still need to add my secondary YouTube channel to my link page, but that issue should be resolved by the time this is published. 

That's about it really, I ought to head off to bed now shouldn't I. It is quite late after all. Well I'm going to sign off now, thanks for reading and have a nice whatever time of day it is where you are!
