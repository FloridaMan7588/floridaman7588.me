# This post was archived from my original Jekyll-based site

Hello yet again! I've once again emerged to bring you updates as to what I am doing. You may have noticed very little of anything from me, but that is to be expected with school and a recently acquired position at a local lawn company taking most of my time from me. I have recently been on a school break and was able to get a bit of work in on some projects, such as yet again redefining my home-labs infrastructure and some other fun things soon to come. One such thing is a PiHole HTTP Webhook thing. I don't know what to call it and I'm also not quite sure Webhook is the correct word, but it's what I'll be going with for the foreseeable future. The source for this software is available [here](https://github.com/floridaman7588/pihole-webhook), with documentation available as well.

I am also working on a couple other things, the main one being a project I started a while ago and haven't introduced yet. This project is..... A Self-Hosted Certificate Authority! I know, I know, you probably already have some solution for HTTPS at home, but this is a simplified version of whatever solution you may run. Currently it is extremely-beta, with barely any functionality besides a couple of core things. I wasn't planning on introducing it until more was done but who cares really. I will elaborate in further posts and updates but the basic concept is that it issues SSL certificates with a self-signed root certificate. The only difference between my tool and using the CLI or something is that it is managed via a WebUI and not a text interface such as the CLI. It's just meant to simplify the experience so that beginners and experienced users alike can use SSL on their local services.

There is more for me to talk about but that will probably end up in a post further down the line. It's getting a bit late for me so I will probably be heading to bed here shortly and won't continue writing. That's all from me for now folks, remember to look out for further posts and updates, and I'll see ya round. Bye!
