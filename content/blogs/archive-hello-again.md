# This post was archived from my original Jekyll-based site

Hello, it's been a while. I've been busy with school and everything but I'm sure chugging along here. I was busy working with some docker compose scripts and such a while back working with my smart home but otherwise I haven't been doing much. I've tried to get some work done on the docker things and my (hopefully) coming soon reddit bot, but I just haven't had much time. You can try to expect more from me, but you never know. The website is pretty much finished, I've only got a few housekeeping things to work on (commenting, RSS, EMail feed, etc.) so there probably won't be much else to see for a while. I will try and get at least the bungeecord container updated for the latest version of Minecraft & Bungeecord, but that's probably about it for a while. I am getting pretty tired, so I think I'm going to sign off for now. Have a good day/night/whatever and goodbye!
