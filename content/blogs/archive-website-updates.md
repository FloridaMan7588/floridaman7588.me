# This post was archived from my original Jekyll-based site

Hi! You may have noticied nothing, the website still isn't avaliable on the open web yet. That means there is a very slim chance that you are reading this unless I know you personally. If you are reading this, cool. I've been working on my website here and I've added a couple pages, as well as some other special little things around the place. You may notice the 'Cydia' and 'AltStore Source' tabs at the top appearing. Those are pretty self-explanatory to most people that my audience consists of. If you don't understand what they are, clicking on them probably won't help either unfortunatley. The are what they say they are. But anyways anyways, these new pages aren't just pages. They allow direct access to what each one states that it might be. Have a look, and a few clicks around. You might find yourself adding my AltSource through a link or two (Hint, Hint). Yeah that's really about it, I'm hoping to purchase a domain name soon so that this website will be nice and proper. Once that happens this site will probably be near completion anyways. Check back soon for more details and updates, hope to see you.
