        Hi! I'm a 15 year old high school student who likes to make things online. I'm not very good at it, but I do it. I also enjoy singing, and sometimes playing video games. Sometimes I stream on YouTube, although I haven't uploaded there in a couple of years. I'll talk about my shenanigans here, and sometimes I write on Mastodon too.
